# AutoXL
AutoXL is a python program to automate excel or spreadsheet to perform a task which earlier consumed considerable time doing manually. But with AutoXL it can be done in a matter of seconds. 
Apart from automating and fixing the xlsx file, a bar chart is also added to display the corrected column as a reference.
